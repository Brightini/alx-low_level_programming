# STRUCTURES IN C

This project covers the concept of Strutures using C language. Structures are user-defined data-types.


## TASKS
- [dog.h](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/dog.h): a header file which contains the declaration of a structure for variables of type ``struct dog``

- [1-init_dog.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/1-init_dog.c): a function that initialises the members of a ``struct dog`` variable

- [2-print_dog.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/2-print_dog.c): a function that prints the values of the members of a ``struct dog`` variable

- [dog.h](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/dog.h): defines a new type ``dog_t`` as a new name for the type ``struct dog``. ``typedef`` was used to achieve this.

- [4-new_dog.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/4-new_dog.c): a function that creates a new dog

- [5-free_dog.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/5-free_dog.c): frees memory allocated to dog objects.
