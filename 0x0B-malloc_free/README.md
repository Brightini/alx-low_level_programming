# C - MALLOC AND FREE
This project covers the concept of dynamic memory allocation using ``malloc`` and ``free`` functions. For more details on these functions,
man
- ``malloc``
- ``free``

``valgrind``, a programming tool used to monitor allocated and deallocated memory is also used.

## TASKS
- [0-create_array.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/0-create_array.c): a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- [1-strdup.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/1-strdup.c): a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. This is similar to the ``strdup`` function.
- [2-str_concat.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/2-str_concat.c): a function that concatenates two strings. The returned pointer points to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and is null terminated
- [3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c): a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers. Each element of the grid is initialized to 0
- [4-free_grid.c](): a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by [3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c) function.
- [100-argstostr.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/100-argstostr.c): a function that concatenates all the arguments of a program
- [101-strtow.c](https://github.com/Brightini/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/101-strtow.c): this function splits a string into words. It returns a pointer to an array of strings (words), where each element of the array contains a single word, null-terminated. The last element of the returned array is NULL and the words are separated by spaces.
